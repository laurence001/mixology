**mixology** is an R package providing eight sentiment lexicons and helper
functions for comparative opinion mining, developed as part of the
[Mixology open research project](https://ohmybox.info) by
[Laurence Dierickx](https://ohmybox.info). The project analyses public
opinion expressed on Twitter during the Covid-19 crisis, focusing on
Western European accounts (December 2021).

## Lexicons

All lexicons share a common three-category polarity scheme —
**positive**, **negative**, **ambiguous** — enabling straightforward
cross-lexicon comparison. The six general-purpose dictionaries have been
harmonised from their original formats.

| Short name | Full name | Terms | Positive | Negative | Ambiguous |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `inquirer` | General Inquirer | 4,206 | 1,915 (45.5%) | 2,291 (54.5%) | — |
| `subjectivity` | MPQA Subjectivity | 6,884 | 2,298 (33.4%) | 4,147 (60.2%) | 439 (6.4%) |
| `bing` | Bing Liu | 6,783 | 2,005 (29.6%) | 4,778 (70.4%) | — |
| `nrc` | NRC Emotion Lexicon | 6,456 | 2,772 (43.0%) | 3,601 (55.8%) | 83 (1.3%) |
| `afinn` | AFINN | 2,477 | 878 (35.4%) | 1,598 (64.5%) | 1 (0.0%) |
| `loughran` | Loughran-McDonald | 3,917 | 354 (9.0%) | 3,250 (83.0%) | 313 (8.0%) |
| `covid` | **Mixology Covid Lexicon** | **4,166** | **1,953 (46.9%)** | **1,924 (46.2%)** | **289 (6.9%)** |
| `mixology` | **Mixology Lexicon** | **16,528** | **5,716 (34.6%)** | **9,655 (58.4%)** | **1,157 (7.0%)** |

The **Mixology Covid Lexicon** was built by manually reviewing 4,500 frequent
tokens from a corpus of 596,619 English tweets (Western Europe,
December 2021), cross-referenced against the six general-purpose dictionaries
using bigram and trigram context. The **Mixology Lexicon** merges all seven
resources after manual conflict resolution.

Unlike general-purpose dictionaries, which carry a systematic surplus of
negative terms, the Covid lexicon has a near-balanced distribution, reducing
the negative bias typically observed when applying off-the-shelf resources to
domain-specific corpora.

## Installation

```r
remotes::install_github("laurence001/mixology")
```

**Dependencies:** dplyr, tidytext, stringr, tibble, rlang (all on CRAN).

---

## Quick start

```r
library(mixology)
library(dplyr)

tweets <- c(
  "The lockdown is terrible and completely unjustified",
  "The vaccine rollout has been excellent, great progress",
  "I am not sure about the booster at all"
)

# 1. Compare all eight lexicons at once
compare_lexicons(tweets)

# 2. Score with one lexicon
mixology_sentiment(tweets, lexicon = "covid")

# 3. Weighted + negation-aware
mixology_sentiment(tweets,
  lexicon         = "covid",
  weighted        = TRUE,
  handle_negation = TRUE
)

# 4. Coverage diagnostic before full analysis
lexicon_coverage(tweets)

# 5. Find terms with conflicting polarities across lexicons
lexicon_conflicts(c("covid", "bing", "nrc"))
```

---

## R pipelines

Two ready-to-use R scripts are bundled with the package and can be opened
directly from RStudio:

```r
# Basic usage and function examples
file.edit(system.file("pipeline.R", package = "mixology"))

# Full pipeline for large corpora (300k+ tweets), with:
#   - chunk-based processing
#   - Covid vs Mixology comparison
#   - benchmark across all 8 lexicons
#   - coverage-corrected inter-lexicon stability (simple and strict variants)
#   - synthetic performance score
file.edit(system.file("pipeline_300k.R", package = "mixology"))
```

---

## Design notes

**Ambiguity over neutrality.** Terms that can be positive or negative
depending on context (e.g. *tested positive*, *government*, *restrictions*)
are labelled `ambiguous` rather than excluded or forced into a binary.
This is particularly relevant for Covid-related discourse, where standard
polarities are frequently reversed.

**Harmonisation of general lexicons.** Original categories were mapped as
follows before merging:

- *AFINN*: scores binarised (positive / negative); 0 → ambiguous
- *Loughran*: constraining + litigious → negative; uncertainty + superfluous → ambiguous
- *NRC*: anger + fear + sadness + disgust → negative; anticipation + trust + joy → positive; surprise → ambiguous
- *MPQA*: neutral + both → ambiguous

**Corpus weights.** The `weight` column (Mixology lexicons only) encodes
log-normalised token frequency from the corpus of 596,619 English tweets
(Western Europe, December 2021):

```
weight = 0.5 + (log(freq + 1) / log(max_freq + 1)) × 2.5
```

Range: 0.5 (unseen) to 3.0 (most frequent term, *vaccine*). Weights can be
recomputed from any corpus — see the vignette.

---

## Known limitations

- Scoring is **unigram-based**; multi-word expressions are not handled.
- Negation uses a **fixed sliding window** and does not resolve scope across
  clause boundaries.
- Weights are derived from a **single sub-corpus** and may not transfer to
  other domains or time periods.
- Lexicons cover **English only**. French resources are in development.
